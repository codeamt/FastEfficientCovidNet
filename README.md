# udacity-mle-capstone-project
This GitHub Repository contains my final project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## About 
This is a Chest X-Ray (CXR) classification API. Building on previous work of [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09871v3.pdf), the CovNet model for this ML project utilizes a pre-trained EfficientNet-b1 to extract features and a fine-tuned Fast.ai classifier to differentiate between infection classes (Normal, Viral Pneumonia, or COVID-19) with 95% test accuracy.

 ## Instructions: 
Each submodule provides an .ipynb file for a detailed walkthrough of that project phase.

In the data submodule, to generate the COVIDx dataset, you'll neet a kaggle account. If you don't have an account, you can create one at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). From there, from the top right menu, visit My Account > API > create New API Token > ... to get a JSON  hardfile of your API Token.

In the deployment submodule, if you'd like to run the quick start demo notebook, you'll also need to create a [ngrok]() account and API token and a from
